# DSA Problems in TypeScript for Front-End Developers

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, all implemented in TypeScript. The primary objective of this repository is to facilitate the learning of DSA concepts while enhancing TypeScript proficiency for front-end developers.

The repo is organized by day, with each day containing a set of problems. The problems are designed to be challenging but achievable, and they cover a variety of DSA topics, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

## Key Features

- **Basics Folder:** Beginners in TypeScript can leverage the Basics folder to initiate their TypeScript journey.
- **Comprehensive Problem Set:** The repository houses a rich collection of TypeScript-based DSA problems that span from 0 to 100.
- **Day-wise Organization:** Problems are meticulously organized daily, aiding in a structured learning approach.
- **Detailed Solutions:** A meticulous TypeScript solution, complete with a thorough explanation, accompanies each problem.
- **Open Source Community:** As an open-source repository, you are encouraged to contribute your solutions or propose novel problem ideas.

## Getting Started

To set up TypeScript, you can follow these steps:

1. Install TypeScript globally by executing this command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```
2. Verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   npx tsc
   ```
   This will display the TypeScript version information.
3. To compile a TypeScript file to JavaScript, run:

```bash
tsc program.ts
```

This command will convert the program.ts file into a program.js file. 4. Execute the compiled JavaScript code using:

```bash
node program.js
```

This will display the output of your program.

Alternatively, you can directly run TypeScript files using the ts-node package. Here's how:

1. Install the TypeScript Node.js package globally with the following:

```bash
npm install -g ts-node
```

2. Compile and run TypeScript files directly using:

```bash
ts-node program.ts
```
