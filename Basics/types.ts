// Here are some basic programs on type in time as i encounter more new types i will add them here

//In Typescript we are mentioning the type of the variable helps us to write more robust code
let greetings:string = 'Hello World!';

//Javascript doesn't have any special runtime value for integers, so there's no equivalent to int or float - everything is simply number 
let number:number = 10;

let isTrue:boolean = true;



console.log(greetings + ' ' + number + ' ' + isTrue);
