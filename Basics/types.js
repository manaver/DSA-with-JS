// Here are some basic programs on type in time as i encounter more new types i will add them here
//In Typescript we are mentioning the type of the variable helps us to write more robust code
var greetings = 'Hello World!';
//Javascript doesn't have any special runtime value for integers, so there's no equivalent to int or float - everything is simply number 
var number = 10;
var isTrue = true;
console.log(greetings + ' ' + number + ' ' + isTrue);
